			Just a welcome to my Blog site. This is based on my Khan Academy project but I haven&39;t looked at it - except for the colour scheme - for this re-creation. I want to embed the knowledge in my head and this is also a different way of doing it slightly because I plan to have other files referenced for CSS and JavaScript.
